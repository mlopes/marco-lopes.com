Hi,

My name is Marco Lopes, and this is my latest attempt at writing a personal
blog. Here I will more or less frequently post articles related to my
interests.

My interestes are usually techincal and delivery oriented, so I might be
writing hard core technical posts, or more process oriented posts about domain
or behaviour driven design, as well as lean and agile.

I'm also interested in game development and design, but content related to
that will be more likely to be found on my game development focused blog
[The Lemon Behind The Sofa](http://thelemonbehindthesofa.com/).

Thanks for reading. Hope you enjoy the content.

Marco Lopes
