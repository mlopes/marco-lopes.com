In the previous chapters we've mentioned currying and partial application.
Let's try to give some clarity as to what those two things mean.

# Currying

Currying is a simple concept that is a bit hard to pass across, if you never
came across it before. Let's say you have a function `f` that takes 3 `Int`
values, `x`, `y`, and `z` and returns a value `r` of type `String`, in Scala 
the signature would look something like this `def f(x: Int, y: Int, z: Int): String`.
You can also think of it as a function that takes `x` and returns another function
that takes `y` and `z`, and returns `r`, like `def f(x: Int): (Int, Int) => String`.
In turn, you can do the same thing with the return function and make it into a
function that takes `y`, and returns a function that takes `z` and returns `r`.
So, you end up with a function `def f(x: Int): (Int => (Int => String))`, or,
because `=>` associates to the right, we can lose the parentheses, and end up with
`def f(x: Int): Int => Int => String`, using syntax sugar `def f(x:Int)(y: Int)(z: Int): String`.

What we did here, was we broke down our 3 parameter function into 3 functions that
take 1 parameter each.
The possibility of treating functions like this was developed and proved by
mathematicians, amongst them Haskell Curry, after whom the technique was later
named, as well as _Haskell_ the language.

## Uses of currying

In _Haskell_, all functions are curried by default. This means that if you declare
a function with more than one parameter, behind the scenes that functions just takes
one parameter and returns another function that takes one parameter and so on.
In _Scala_, functions are not inherently pure, so you have to manually curry a function,
because if a function performs a side effect the interpreter won't know if it can partially
apply it without breaking it's procedural order, for example, in the case of a function
that requests input from the user, that action doesn't depend on the function inputs, but
subsequent instructions on that function might. So, if you want a function to be curried,
you have to explicitly say so and take responsibility to not break it. The example above
would become `def f(x:Int)(y: Int)(z: Int): String`, meaning that the function is now curried.

But why would we want to curry a function?
That takes us to the next section. Partial application.

# Partial Application

If a function with arity greater than 1 (a function with more than 1
parameter), becomes a function with arity of 1 that returns another function,
then, we can always call the function with only that parameter back. This is
called partial application. So, for example, if you have the following
function:

```haskell
f :: Int -> Int -> Int -> String
f x y z = show (x + y + z)
```

You can always partially apply it, by calling the function without passing all
of the three parameters, for example `f 2` would return a function of type
`Int -> Int -> String` and `f 2 3` would return a function of type
`Int -> String`. In _Scala_, the above example calls would be `f(2)` and
`f(2)(3)`, given that `f` had been declared as curried.

An example of how this can be useful, can be seen with _Haskell_'s `fmap`
function, but not with _Scala_'s `map` method due to _Scala_ being OO and the
thus the value we're mapping over becoming an implicit instance on the
method.
So, the signature of `fmap` is `fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b`, so, we can do the
following:

```haskell
add2 :: Integer -> Integer
add2 x = x + 2

fmap add2 $ Some 3
```

The result would be `Some 5`, because we're mapping the `add2` function over
the `Some` value. Another thing we could do is partially apply `fmap`:

```haskell
add2InF = fmap add2
:t add2InF
```
Because `:t` shows the type of an expression, we will see that the type of
`add2InF` is `add2InF :: Functor f => f Integer -> f Integer`, we've partially applied `fmap` to lift
our `add2` function so that it now can be applied to a value in the context of `f`
We can now do:

```haskell
add2InF $ Just 5
```

which results in `Just 7` [^1]

or

```haskell
add2InF [1,2,3]
```

Which returns `[3,4,5]`

In Scala, currying and partial application are often used when a function
require parameters that are configuration/dependencies and parameters that are
the values it will act upon. That way, we can partially apply the
configuration/common dependencies, and get back a function that takes only the
values. For example:

```scala
def transform[A, B](parser: Parser[A])(value: A): B = ???
```
By passing a parser to `transform`, we get back a function that takes a value
of `A` and returns a value of `B`, which we can use with any `A`, without
having to repeatedly pass the parser around.

It's worth mentioning, that, as [pschwarz](https://disqus.com/by/pschwarz/)
commented bellow, in Scala you can curry functions at run time, so an adapted
version of his example (with some minor changes for ease of understanding to
newcomers):

```scala
val add = { (x:Int , y: Int)  => x + y }

val add3 = add.curried(3)

val result = add3(5)
// result: Int = 8
```

Next we're going to take a look at type parameters, before diving into the basics of
what is an effect system, and what benefits it can bring us.

[^1]: The `$` is a precedence operator and it's there to tell the compiler to evaluate the `Just 5` before trying to apply `add2InF`. If it wouldn't be there, then it would try to apply `add2InF` to `Just` and then pass `5` as a parameter to the result. This would not type-check and therefore wouldn't compile.
