Delivered a talk at the Manchester Magento User Group, about how to use [Modelling by
Example](http://stakeholderwhisperer.com/posts/2014/10/introducing-modelling-by-example),
a Domain Driven Design technique which uses Gherkin examples as a framework to
drive the development of software, to achieve decoupling from legacy
frameworks, a consistent and cohesive core domain model, and a maintainable
application.
