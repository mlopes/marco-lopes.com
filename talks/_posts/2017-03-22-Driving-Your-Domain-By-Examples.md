I had a third opportunity to deliver the Driving Your Domain By Examples talk.
This time at the Code Mastery meetup. This version had some further
improvements over the previous ones and is also available on video online.
Unfortunatelly, the video failed to capture the questions at the end, which
was possibly the most interesting part of the talk.

You can see the presentation slides bellow:
