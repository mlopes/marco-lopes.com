Ever thought about all of those rules, laws and guidelines for software
development? Ever noticed what all of those good practices have in common?
That's right, they all boil down to simplicity. Keep things as simple as
possible, but not simpler than that.

That's the topic of this short talk I've delivered internally at
[Inviqa](http://inviqa.com). It focused on identifying the pitfalls that can
lead you into adding uneeded complexity and how to avoid them.

The slides can be seen bellow:
