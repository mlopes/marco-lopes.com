Delivered a talk at the Manchester Magento User Group, about how to use [Modelling by
Example](http://stakeholderwhisperer.com/posts/2014/10/introducing-modelling-by-example),
a Domain Driven Design technique which uses Gherkin examples as a framework to
drive the development of software, to achieve decoupling from legacy
frameworks, a consistent and cohesive core domain model, and a maintainable
application.

The videos was available online, but has been removed, I'm working on getting
it back online, and will share it here when available.

The slides for the presentation can be seen bellow:
