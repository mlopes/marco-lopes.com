On May the 4th 2017, I delivered an internal talk to my coleagues at
[Inviqa](http://inviqa.com), about game development. It focused on the history
of how I've been developing games, the problems and benefits of developing a
game by oneself, and an overview of the choice of tools for indie game
development.
