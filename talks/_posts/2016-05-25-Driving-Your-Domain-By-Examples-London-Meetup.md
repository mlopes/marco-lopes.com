After presenting the Driving Your Domain by Examples talk at Developer's
Paradise in Croatia, I was asked if I could present it at the London Magento
Meetup the next month. I reworked the talk slightly and presented it again.
This version of the talk is available on video.

The slides can be seen bellow:

The video is also available online:
